# Covid-19-Data-Exploration-project
The Covid-19 Data Exploration project using SQL (Microsoft SQL Server) is a project that aims to analyze and understand the impact of Covid 19 on different locations and populations. The project utilizes various SQL skills such as Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions (MAX - SUM), Creating Views, and Converting Data Types.

The project starts with selecting the data that will be used for analysis. The selected data includes Location, Date, Total Cases, New Cases, Total Deaths, and Population. This data is then stored in a database using Microsoft SQL Server.

Once the data is stored in the database, various SQL skills are used to analyze and understand the impact of Covid-19 on different locations and populations. Joins are used to combine data from different tables to create a comprehensive dataset that can be analyzed.

CTE's (Common Table Expressions) are used to simplify complex queries and make them more readable. Temp Tables are used to store intermediate results during the analysis process.

Windows Functions are used to calculate running totals and averages over time. Aggregate Functions such as MAX and SUM are used to calculate total cases and deaths for each location.

Creating Views is another skill utilized in this project. Views are created to simplify complex queries by creating virtual tables that can be queried like regular tables.

Finally, Converting Data Types is an important skill utilized in this project. Data types need to be converted appropriately for accurate analysis.

In conclusion, the Covid 19 Data Eploration project using SQL (Microsoft SQL Server) is an essential tool for understanding the impact of Covid-19 on different locations and populations. It utilizes various SQL skills such as Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions (MAX - SUM), Creating Views, and Converting Data Types to analyze Covid-19 data effectively.
